What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You may also wish to run git status after you have created the file. You should see that now 
both files are listed as untracked files.

New question, I have to commit it this time.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Now that youâ€™ve learned how to create a branch in Git, go add the following question and 
your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?
How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They're terrific quite honestly. They help a lot.
